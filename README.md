# Open Simplex Noise
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doughsay/crystal-open-simplex-noise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doughsay/crystal-open-simplex-noise)

This is an implementation of 2D, 3D, and 4D open simplex noise in crystal.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yml
dependencies:
  open-simplex-noise:
    github: doughsay/crystal-open-simplex-noise
    version: "~> 1.0"
  ...
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "open-simplex-noise"
```

Instantiate a noise generator using an `Int64` seed:

```crystal
noise = OpenSimplexNoise.new(12345_i64)
```

Use the `generate` method, passing in either 2, 3, or 4 `Float64`s to generate noise:

```crystal
noise.generate(1.0, 2.0)
#=> -0.08284024020120388
```

## Examples
